# Chapter 12: Recovery by the Fire

Safely back inside **The Foaming Mug**, Fuor and Ermin sit by the peat fire. Sitting down (`rest`) accelerates health recovery, while drinking fresh well water (`drink water`) and eating biscuits (`eat biscuit`) maintain rapid health regeneration.

Help Fuor rest (`rest`), stand (`wake`), quench his thirst (`drink water`), and eat (`eat biscuit`) below!
