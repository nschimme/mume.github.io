    The Foaming Mug's Beer Garden
    Wooden tables have been set on the grass in this garden allowing those staying
    at the inn to eat and drink outdoors when the weather permits. A simple stone
    wall running around the edge of the grass keeps this area private. Faint sounds
    of horses neighing and whinnying can be heard from mounts tethered in the
    stables to the south.
    A large lamp stands on the wall here, locked into an iron fixture.
    A small oaken table has been set here.
    On the table, there is a piece of cheese.
    A circular stone well has been built here.
    Exits: south, west.
