# Non-Technical Authoring Guide for MUME Interactive Tutorial

This directory (`docs/play/tutorial/`) contains all the interactive tutorial chapters for MUME.
The system is designed so that **anyone** can edit existing chapters or add new chapters using simple Markdown and YAML frontmatter without writing any code.

---

## Quick Start: How It Works

1. **Automatic Chapter Discovery**: Every Markdown file in this directory named `[number]-[slug].md` (e.g., `1-orientation.md`, `2-look-exits.md`, `16-new-topic.md`) is automatically detected, sorted by number, and added to the interactive tutorial sequence and command guides.
2. **Zero Code Required**: You do not need to edit any JavaScript, Vue files, or templates. Just create or edit a `.md` file!
3. **Pure Markdown**: Chapter content is written in standard Markdown. The website layout automatically wraps your chapter inside the interactive terminal player.

## How to Add a New Chapter

1. Create a new file in `docs/play/tutorial/` following the naming convention `[number]-[slug].md` (for example, `16-advanced-tactics.md`).
2. Copy the template below into your file.
3. Fill in the title, description, commands, interactive steps, and lesson text.
4. Save and commit your file!
